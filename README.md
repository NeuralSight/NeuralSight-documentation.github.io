# Company Charter

## THE PROBLEM
In Africa, healthcare services are overused yet under-resourced challenging healthcare
providers with a significant burden to diseases. A patientâ€™s wait time to receive analyzed lab
results is often more than 2 weeks. This has resulted in late treatment reducing the chances of
survival especially with fast killing diseases such as Tuberculosis, Pneumonia and COVID-19.

## Value Proposition
Using Deep Learning and Computer Vision our technology screens x-rays for radiologists and
hospitals in real time to identify over 13 respiratory diseases such as Pneumonia, TB, and lung
cancer. Now, instead of waiting for two weeks, we empower doctors to provide accurate diagnoses
before patients even get their shirts back on.

## Project Scope
Neural Labs Africa is carrying out its operations in West Africa focusing on Francophone Africa.
Such plans to upscale our technology in different African regions is fostered by our vision to
build a solution for Africa, a region where diseases are overwhelming its population. Using our
current MVP to run clinical trials of our Software where we are engaging end-users to provide
tailor made predictive models within the diverse medical imaging modalities. Moreover, Neural
Labs Africa is focusing on strategic partnerships with hospitals, Tele-Radiology Laboratories,
and specialists to help impact and improve healthcare delivery within the different institutions.

## Project Risks
Access to Data is among the most pressing challenges we are facing. This is because different
countries have different data regulations. For example, in Kenya Data collected within the
Kenyan demographic region should be stored within the Kenyan Demographic region as a result
most hospitals and institutions prefer to keep their data offline to meet these thresholds hence
such data is not accessible on cloud.

## Values and Principles
The solutions that Neural Labs Africa creates for clients are only as excellent as the people who
create them. Neural Labs Africa conducts cultural experiments and actively involves its staff in
evolving the company's culture. The culture essentially combines agile administration,
independence, self-governance, routine evaluations, and participation monitoring.
This strategy has influenced mentoring and growth in the future. The transparency of Neural
Labs Africa is something we take great delight in. The company has shared the project repository
on open source platforms for the open sourc
